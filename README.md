## Introduction
We employed Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to construct an expanded microbial carbon cycling database (eMCCDB), which included carbon fixation and methane metabolism pathways. 
The database contained 23,246 orthologous groups and 338,834 allelic genes, encompassing 10 carbon cycling pathways with 68 gene families.
