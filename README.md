## Introduction
We employed Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to construct an expanded microbial carbon-cycling gene database (eMCCDB), which included carbon fixation and methane metabolism pathways. 
This database contained 23,246 orthologous groups and 338,834 allelic genes, encompassing 10 carbon cycling pathways.
